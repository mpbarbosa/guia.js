## Feature Summary

<!-- Briefly describe the feature or enhancement you are proposing. What should it do? -->

## Motivation

<!-- Explain why this feature is needed. What problem does it solve, or what value does it add? -->

## Use Cases

<!-- Describe real-world scenarios or examples where this feature would be beneficial. -->

## Proposed Solution

<!-- Suggest how the feature might be implemented. Include any ideas about design, workflow, or code changes. -->

### Implementation Considerations

<!-- When designing the feature, consider: -->
<!-- - Can core logic be implemented as pure functions (referentially transparent)? -->
<!-- - How can we separate business logic from side effects (I/O, mutations)? -->
<!-- - Will the implementation be easy to test in isolation? -->
<!-- - Are all dependencies explicit (passed as parameters vs global state)? -->
<!-- See .github/REFERENTIAL_TRANSPARENCY.md for best practices -->

**Development Guidelines:**
- Referential transparency: [REFERENTIAL_TRANSPARENCY.md](../.github/REFERENTIAL_TRANSPARENCY.md)
- Code review standards: [CODE_REVIEW_GUIDE.md](../.github/CODE_REVIEW_GUIDE.md)
- Testing approach: [TDD_GUIDE.md](../.github/TDD_GUIDE.md), [UNIT_TEST_GUIDE.md](../.github/UNIT_TEST_GUIDE.md)
- Architecture principles: [LOW_COUPLING_GUIDE.md](../.github/LOW_COUPLING_GUIDE.md), [HIGH_COHESION_GUIDE.md](../.github/HIGH_COHESION_GUIDE.md)
