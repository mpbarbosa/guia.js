# CI/CD Quick Reference Card

## 🚀 Developer Commands (Daily Use)

### Before Committing
```bash
npm run validate       # Syntax check (<1s)
npm run test:changed   # Test changed files (1-2s)
npm run lint:fix       # Auto-fix style issues
```

### Manual Testing
```bash
npm test               # All tests (~7s)
npm run test:all       # Validate + tests (~8s)
npm run test:coverage  # With coverage (~7s)
```

### Test by Category
```bash
npm run test:unit         # Unit tests only (~6s, 657 tests)
npm run test:integration  # Integration tests (~5s, 277 tests)
npm run test:features     # Feature tests (~2s, ~100 tests)
npm run test:services     # Service tests (~1s, ~50 tests)
```

## 📋 Pre-commit Hook

**Location**: `.husky/pre-commit`

**Runs automatically** on `git commit`:
1. Validates JavaScript syntax
2. Runs tests for changed files only
3. Takes 1-2 seconds

**Bypass** (emergency only):
```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "message"
```

## �� GitHub Actions Pipeline

**Workflow**: `.github/workflows/test.yml`

### Stages (Parallel)
```
Stage 1: Lint & Validate (5s)
    ↓
├─ Stage 2: Unit Tests (4s)
├─ Stage 3a: Integration Tests (3s)
├─ Stage 3b: Feature Tests (2s)
└─ Stage 3c: Service Tests (1s)
    ↓
Stage 4: Coverage Gate (7s)
    ↓
Stage 5: PR Changed Files (1-2s, PR only)
```

**Total time**: ~16s

## 📊 Coverage Thresholds

**Current** (must pass):
- Statements: ≥65% (actual: 67.09%)
- Branches: ≥69% (actual: 69.51%)
- Functions: ≥55% (actual: 57.16%)
- Lines: ≥65% (actual: 67.29%)

**Services** (relaxed):
- Branches: ≥20%
- Functions: ≥18%

## 🐛 Common Issues

### Pre-commit hook too slow
```bash
npm run test:changed  # Should be 1-2s, not 7s
# If slow, check which files changed
```

### Coverage failing
```bash
npm run test:coverage  # Check actual %
# Add tests or adjust threshold
```

### Tests failing on CI but not locally
```bash
npm ci                 # Clean install
npm run test:coverage  # Match CI environment
```
