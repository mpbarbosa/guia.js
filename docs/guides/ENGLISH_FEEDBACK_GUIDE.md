## 💡 Practical Examples

### Example 1: Simple Grammar Correction

**User prompt:**

```
[[ENGLISH-FEEDBACK]] I need to update the tests what is failing
```

**Copilot response:**

```
📝 ENGLISH FEEDBACK
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ORIGINAL TEXT:
"I need to update the tests what is failing"

GRAMMAR ISSUES:
❌ "tests what is failing" → ✅ "tests that are failing"
   - Use "that" (not "what") for relative clauses referring to things
   - Subject-verb agreement: "tests" is plural, use "are" not "is"

POLISHED VERSION:
"I need to update the tests that are failing"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

### Example 2: Complex Technical Prompt

**User prompt:**

```
[[ENGLISH-FEEDBACK]] We should to refactor the code for make it more better and less complex because the new developers are having difficulty to understand the architecture
```

**Copilot response:**

```
📝 ENGLISH FEEDBACK
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ORIGINAL TEXT:
"We should to refactor the code for make it more better and less complex because
the new developers are having difficulty to understand the architecture"

GRAMMAR ISSUES:
❌ "should to refactor" → ✅ "should refactor"
   - "Should" is a modal verb; don't use "to" after modals

❌ "for make it" → ✅ "to make it"
   - Use "to" (infinitive), not "for" before verbs of purpose

❌ "more better" → ✅ "better" (or "much better")
   - "Better" is already comparative; don't use "more" with it

❌ "difficulty to understand" → ✅ "difficulty understanding"
   - Use gerund (-ing form) after "difficulty"

VOCABULARY SUGGESTIONS:
• "less complex" → "simpler" or "less complicated"
  Reason: More concise

CLARITY IMPROVEMENTS:
"We should refactor the code to make it simpler because new developers are
having difficulty understanding the architecture"

STYLE RECOMMENDATIONS:
More professional version:
"We should refactor the code to improve its clarity and reduce complexity,
as new developers are struggling to understand the architecture"

POLISHED VERSION:
"We should refactor the code to make it simpler and easier to understand,
as new developers are having difficulty with the current architecture"

### Example 3: Casual to Professional

**User prompt:**

```
[[ENGLISH-FEEDBACK]] Can you check out the bug in the login page? It's kinda broken and users are getting mad
```

**Copilot response:**

```
📝 ENGLISH FEEDBACK
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ORIGINAL TEXT:
"Can you check out the bug in the login page? It's kinda broken and users
are getting mad"

VOCABULARY SUGGESTIONS:
• "check out" → "investigate" or "examine"
  Reason: More professional, less casual

• "kinda broken" → "not functioning properly" or "malfunctioning"
  Reason: "Kinda" is informal; be specific about the issue

• "getting mad" → "frustrated" or "experiencing issues"
  Reason: More professional, less emotional

STYLE RECOMMENDATIONS:
Transform from casual conversation to professional technical communication:
- Remove contractions in formal writing ("It's" → "It is")
- Use technical vocabulary
- Maintain professional tone

POLISHED VERSION:
"Could you investigate the bug in the login page? It is not functioning
properly and users are experiencing frustration"

OR (more concise):
"Please investigate the login page bug that is causing user frustration"

## 📚 Quick Reference for Portuguese Speakers

### Common Grammar Pitfalls

#### 1. False Cognates (False Friends)

**Portuguese → English (WRONG) → English (CORRECT)**

| Portuguese | Looks like... | Actually means... |
|------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Atualmente | Actually | Currently |
| Pretender | Pretend | Intend, plan to |
| Assistir | Assist | Watch, attend |
| Realizar | Realize | Accomplish, carry out |
| Eventualmente | Eventually | Occasionally |
| Esquisito | Exquisite | Strange, weird |
| Parentes | Parents | Relatives |
| Sensível | Sensible | Sensitive |
| Resumir | Resume | Summarize |
| Suportar | Support | Endure, tolerate |

**Examples:**

```
❌ "Actually, I am working on this feature"
✅ "Currently, I am working on this feature"

❌ "I pretend to finish this by Friday"
✅ "I intend to finish this by Friday"

❌ "I will assist the presentation"
✅ "I will attend the presentation"
```

---

#### 2. Preposition Differences

**Portuguese → English**

| Context | Portuguese | English |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Arrive | Chegar em | Arrive at/in |
| Depend | Depender de | Depend on |
| Listen | Escutar (direto) | Listen to |
| Wait | Esperar por | Wait for |
| Dream | Sonhar com | Dream about/of |
| Think | Pensar em | Think about |

**Examples:**

```
❌ "I arrived in the office"
✅ "I arrived at the office"

❌ "It depends of the situation"
✅ "It depends on the situation"

❌ "I am waiting the response"
✅ "I am waiting for the response"
```

---

#### 3. Article Usage (a, an, the)

Portuguese uses articles more liberally than English.

**When NOT to use articles in English:**

```
❌ "The life is beautiful" (general concept)
✅ "Life is beautiful"

❌ "I like the programming" (general activity)
✅ "I like programming"

❌ "The software development is complex" (general field)
✅ "Software development is complex"

✅ "The software development at our company is complex" (specific instance)
```

**When TO use "the":**

```
✅ "The documentation we wrote yesterday" (specific documentation)
✅ "The bug you mentioned" (specific bug)
✅ "The code in this repository" (specific code)
```

---

#### 4. Gerund vs Infinitive

In Portuguese, you can use infinitive after many verbs. English is more strict.

**Use GERUND (-ing) after:**

- enjoy, finish, stop, avoid, consider, mind, suggest
- prepositions (after, before, without, for, about)
- "have trouble/difficulty"

**Use INFINITIVE (to + verb) after:**

- want, need, plan, decide, hope, expect, agree
- would like, would prefer

**Examples:**

```
❌ "I enjoy to code"
✅ "I enjoy coding"

❌ "Stop to worry"
✅ "Stop worrying"

❌ "I want going to the meeting"
✅ "I want to go to the meeting"

❌ "We need updating the docs"
✅ "We need to update the docs"
```

---

#### 5. Subject-Verb Agreement

Portuguese allows dropping subject pronouns. English requires explicit subjects.

**Examples:**

```
❌ "Is important to test" (missing subject)
✅ "It is important to test"

❌ "Are many bugs in the code" (missing subject)
✅ "There are many bugs in the code"

❌ "Have three options" (missing subject)
✅ "There are three options" or "We have three options"
```

---

#### 6. Word Order Differences

**Adjective placement:**

Portuguese: noun + adjective
English: adjective + noun

```
❌ "We need a solution better"
✅ "We need a better solution"

❌ "This is a problem serious"
✅ "This is a serious problem"
```

**Question formation:**

```
❌ "You can help me?" (Portuguese word order)
✅ "Can you help me?" (auxiliary verb first)

❌ "When you will finish?" (Portuguese word order)
✅ "When will you finish?" (auxiliary verb after question word)
```

---

### Common Vocabulary Issues

#### Technical Terms - Formal vs Casual

| Casual/Informal | Professional/Formal |
|----------------|---------------------|
| fix | resolve, address, correct |
| broken | malfunctioning, not working properly |
| mess up | corrupt, compromise, introduce errors |
| check out | investigate, examine, review |
| figure out | determine, ascertain, identify |
| get rid of | remove, eliminate, delete |
| kind of/sort of | somewhat, partially |
| a lot of | many, numerous, substantial |
| tons of | numerous, substantial, many |
| really good | excellent, effective, robust |

**Examples in context:**

```
Casual: "Let's fix the broken code"
Professional: "Let's address the malfunctioning code"

Casual: "Can you check out this bug?"
Professional: "Could you investigate this bug?"

Casual: "This solution is really good"
Professional: "This solution is highly effective"
```
