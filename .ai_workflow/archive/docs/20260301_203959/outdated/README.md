## 🚀 Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)

1. ✅ Deploy security fixes (changes already made)
2. ✅ Monitor for 48 hours (no issues expected)
3. ✅ Share EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md with team

### Next Sprint (1-2 weeks)

1. Evaluate ESLint v10 upgrade (use DEPENDENCY_ROADMAP.md Phase 2)
2. Schedule 1-2 hour timebox for testing
3. Document any breaking changes needed
4. Decide: upgrade now or defer to v1.0.0?

### Medium-term (End of sprint)

1. Plan jsdom v28 update (after ESLint v10 decision)
2. Full regression test suite
3. E2E test stability verification
4. Document any DOM API changes needed

### Pre-Release (Before v1.0.0)

1. Stabilize production dependencies (promote from alpha to v1.0.0)
2. Final security audit
3. Zero outdated packages goal

## 📞 FAQ

**Q: Is the security issue critical?**
A: No. It's a low-severity DoS vulnerability (CVSS 3.7) in a dev dependency (http-server). Production code is unaffected. However, it's been fixed for completeness.

**Q: Do we need to update ESLint and jsdom immediately?**
A: No. They're nice-to-haves. Plan for next sprint with testing. Both major versions may require code or config changes.

**Q: What if an update breaks something?**
A: We have a rollback plan documented in DEPENDENCY_ROADMAP.md. Full test suite will catch issues. Can revert with git.

**Q: Is the project production-ready?**
A: Yes! ✅ After these changes, dependency health is excellent. All tests pass, security is clean.

**Q: When should we upgrade production dependencies?**
A: Before releasing Guia Turístico v1.0.0. Coordinate with upstream projects (guia.js, ibira.js) maintainers to promote from alpha to stable.
