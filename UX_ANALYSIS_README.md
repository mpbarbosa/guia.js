## 🎯 Key Findings at a Glance

### 5 Critical Issues (Must Fix First)
1. **Primary action button hierarchy not clear** - Users don't know what to click
2. **Empty state shows "—" with no context** - Users think app is broken  
3. **Touch targets below 48px minimum** - Mobile usability barrier
4. **Speech synthesis status completely hidden** - Accessibility failure
5. **No error recovery paths** - Users stuck when geolocation fails

### 8 Usability Improvements (High Impact)
- Hidden converter feature (discoverability)
- 7 info sections without hierarchy (cognitive overload)
- Inconsistent loading states
- Color contrast issues (WCAG)
- Missing tablet breakpoint (768px)
- No button active state feedback
