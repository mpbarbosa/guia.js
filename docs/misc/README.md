## 📋 Purpose of This Directory

This directory serves as a **controlled archive** for historical documentation that doesn't fit other categories. With the 2026-01-27 reorganization, it now follows strict acceptance criteria to prevent becoming a "dumping ground."

### Acceptance Criteria (Anti-Dumping Ground)

Documents placed in `docs/misc/` MUST meet ALL of these criteria:

✅ **Historical records of completed work only**  
✅ **Must have clear date in filename** (e.g., `*_2026-01-09.md`)  
✅ **Must be referenced from active documentation**  
✅ **Documents older than current release cycle**

❌ **NOT for active guides or current documentation** → Use main `docs/` or specific subdirectories  
❌ **NOT for experimental/draft work** → Use `docs/reports/analysis/` instead  
❌ **NOT for temporary notes** → Delete instead

---

## 🎯 When to Use This Directory

### ✅ SHOULD Go Here

- Historical records that don't fit other categories
- Analysis/planning documents superseded by implementation
- Working notes that have historical value
- Audit trail documentation for specific initiatives

### ❌ Should NOT Go Here

- **Active documentation** → Use `docs/` root or specific subdirectories
- **Analysis reports** → Use `docs/reports/analysis/`
- **Bug fix records** → Use `docs/reports/bugfixes/`
- **Implementation summaries** → Use `docs/reports/implementation/`
- **Planning documents** → Use `docs/infrastructure/` or `docs/architecture/`
- **Temporary notes** → Delete or use session workspace

## 📂 Better Alternatives

Before placing a document in `docs/misc/`, consider these directories:

| Document Type | Recommended Location |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Analysis reports | `docs/reports/analysis/` |
| Bug investigations | `docs/reports/bugfixes/` |
| Implementation summaries | `docs/reports/implementation/` |
| Architecture decisions | `docs/architecture/` |
| Infrastructure planning | `docs/infrastructure/` |
| Testing documentation | `docs/testing/` |
| API integration docs | `docs/api-integration/` |
| Refactoring sessions | `docs/refactoring/` |

## ✍️ Contributing

### Before Adding Files Here

1. **Check if it fits another category** - 90% of documentation has a better home
2. **Verify it meets acceptance criteria** - Must be historical, dated, and referenced
3. **Consider alternatives** - Use session workspace for temporary notes
4. **Update this README** - Add file reference if accepted

### Archival Process

When documentation becomes historical:

1. **Evaluate destination** - Is `docs/misc/` really the best place?
2. **Add date to filename** - Use `YYYY-MM-DD` format
3. **Mark as archived** - Update document status
4. **Add cross-references** - Link from active documentation
5. **Update this README** - Document the addition
